 ## _What is a Restaurant Experience?_

    We created a restaurant experience. This wondrous experience can be described as the following. It is Friday night and you want to meet your friends at your favorite restaruant but are tired from the week and do not feel like standing in line for a table and then having to wait to order your food, and more wait time to get your food. 
    
    Or maybe you want to meet your husband for that romatic dinner but do not feel like waiting for your table and then waiting for your food as well.
    
    The thought of either scenario is exhausting! Now, imagine how life would be different if you could go online, set your dinner reservation along with 
    placing your food order! This way, you drive to the restaurant, are seated 
    right away, and shortly after, your food arrives. 
    ---
  ## _In Summary_
    This project includes making an online dinner reservation plus ordering your food ahead of time. Ths new experience is perfect for the couple/family/or friends that do not have a lot of extra time to stand and wait for their table, and then sit and wait for the waiter to take their order. Then more wait time... And finally, their food arrives. Our guests can also choose to make a table reservation without their food order, if they desire to do so.

  # **How Restaurant Experience for D.K.& L. Dinner House runs**
    * The back-end system uses Spring Boot and Hibernate to connect to a MySQL database.   
    * The application deploys onto a Tomcat Server.
    * The middle tier uses Servlet technology for dynamic Web application development.
    * The front-end view uses Angular to make an application that can call server-side   components.
    * Passwords are encrypted in Java and securely stored in the database.
    * Postman is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document the API. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests.
    ---
  # **Development server**
    
    * This project was generated with Angular
    * Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to your localhost:4200/. 
    * The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
    * Run ng build to build the project.
    
  ## _Phase 1, includes the following_
  
   * Home Page
   * Menu Page  /  Shopping cart & summary of order
   * Reservation Page   /   Guests can select date and time of reservation
   * Login Page   /   Create Account if user chooses to do so.

  # **The annotations used for Java in IntelliJ**
  ### **@order**
    Defines the sorting order of an annotated component or bean. It has an optional value arguement which determined the order of the component; the default value is Ordered.
  ### **@value**
    This annotation is used at the field or method contructor parameter level and it indicates a default value for the affected aregument. It is commonly used for injecting values into configuration variables.
  ### **@Autowired**
    Spring provides annotation-based auto-wiring by providing @Autowired annotation. It is used to autowire spring beans on setter methods, instance variables, and constructor. When we use @Autowired annotation, the spring container auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.
  ### **@Bean**
    It is a method-level annotation. It is an alternative of XML bean tag. It tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by Spring Container.  
  ### **@Configuration**  
    It is a class-level annotation. The class annotated with @Configuration used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions.
  ### **@EnableWebSecurity**
    This allows Spring to find (its's a @Configuration and therfore, Component) and automatically apply the class to the global WebSecurity.
  ### **@PostMapping**
    PostMapping annotation maps HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods.
  ### **@RequestBody**
    Is applicable to handler methods of Spring controllers. This annotation indicates that Spring should deserialize a request body into an object.
  ### **@RestController**
    RestController is used for making restful web services with the help of the RestController annotation.This annotation is used at the class level and allows the class to handle the requests made by the client.
  ### **@JsonIgnore**
    The JsonIgnore annotation is used to ignore the logical property used in serialization and deserialization. This annotation is used at setters, getters, or fields. If you add JasonIgnore to a field or its getter method, the field is not going to be serialized.
  ### **@OnDelete** 
    The OnDelete decides whether deleting an entry from database will delete the rows represented by joined sub class or not.

  # **IDE Used**

  - Microsoft Visual Code
  - IntelliJ

  # **API Used**

  - The Meal DB
  - Postman - used for testing

  # **Logo Creation**

  - The Logo Makr  |  https://www.logomakr.com/

  # **Original Images**

    The original images that were picked for our project came from 
    Pexels /  At the time of writing this README.md file, these photos 
    were not inserted. https://www.pexels.com/search/finedining food/. 
    We ended up using the photos that were stock photos in 'The Meal DB' 
    API due to time constraints.
